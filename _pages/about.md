Bihan Guo is a Lecturer in Horticulture (MinZu College) and a Researcher in Horticulture, Urban Ecology & Big Data Analytics (Yazhou Bay Innovation Institute), Hainan Tropical Ocean University. Building on her ecophysiology background, her current research focuses on big data-driven solutions for horticultural and landscape ecological conservation in the South China Sea region and national parks, advancing sustainable green space development.

During her Ph.D. studies at the University of Melbourne, Bihan conducted extensive research on plant-water relations in herbaceous and woody plants within hot and dry green roof contexts. Her work explored how succulence—total stored plant water—influences green roof plant drought survival, shedding critical light on plant adaptation mechanisms in water-limited environments. Subsequently, she served as a Postdoc in the [Woody Meadow project](https://woodymeadow.unimelb.edu.au/) at the University of Melbourne, investigating how plant survival and performance post-coppicing respond to varying watering regimes, with implications for sustainable green space management.

Her current work integrates multi-source big data (remote sensing, spatial, ecological) to develop analytical models for landscape quality assessment and horticultural resource conservation, translating research insights into practical applications for resilient green space planning.
