title: "Are succulence or trait combinations related to plant survival on hot and dry green roofs?"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'Highlights: 
• We investigated how single traits or trait combinations relate to plant survival.
• Greater substrate depth improved survival, woody plants survived better than herbs.
• Survival was not related to succulence, water use, SLA, root:shoot ratio and T50.
• Species with similar trait combinations had similar survival.'
